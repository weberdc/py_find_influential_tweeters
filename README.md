# py_twitter_analysis
An experimental project to analyse tweet data.

Current metrics generated are a variant on the academic h-index,
a retweeter/mention ratio, a mixture model of retweeter/mention
ratio and interactor ratio, and I haven't written the Duan-rank
implementation yet.

# Usage
`$ bin/twitter_analysis -i <tweets_file> [--verbose]`
